	abstract = {Brain disorders, particularly mental disorders, might be effectively treated by direct electrical brain stimulation, but clinical progress requires understanding of therapeutic mechanisms. Animal models have not helped, because there are no direct animal models of mental illness. We show a path past this roadblock, by leveraging a common ingredient of most mental disorders: impaired cognitive control. We previously showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves cognitive control in humans. We now reverse translate that result, showing that DBS-like stimulation of the mid-striatum improves cognitive control in rats. Using this model, we identify a mechanism, improvement in domain-general cognitive control, and rule out competing hypotheses such as impulsivity. The rat findings explain prior human results and have immediate implications for clinical practice and future trial design.One Sentence Summary Developing a reliable animal model of a human brain stimulation therapy reveals that this therapy works by enhancing the brain{\textquoteright}s ability to process conflicting pieces of evidence.Competing Interest StatementASW is a named inventor on multiple patent applications related to neurostimulation and cognitive control, none of which directly references the information herein and none of which is licensed to any entity.},
